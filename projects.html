		<h1>My Projects!</h1>
		<h2>Project #1: <span class="emphasise italicise">Pokedex</span></h2>
		<p class="italicise">A simple program that gave me some insight about how to work with a big database.<p>
		<h3>Details</h3>
		<p>I originally wrote the pokedex code nearing the end of term 1 in one afternoon at the school library. Back then I had a very big misconception about the parameters in a function and I didn't really know how to read from a CSV file (we were going to learn that in term 2 if i remember correctly) so the code was ugly, but I completed task with whatever I knew.</p>
		<p>I do feel that it's not very efficient and not well written, but I was glad that I managed to make a functioning program. And the surprise feature...it's quite simple. It reverses the names of the pokemon. Originally I was going to permanently reverse it, but I was in a very good mood that day.</p>

		<h2>Project #2: <span class="emphasise italicise">Webfolio</span></h2>
		<p class="italicise">A static webpage that displays all of my computing projects!<p>
		<h3>Details</h3>
		<p>I didn't really have a lot of things to display on my portfolio, so when the teacher assigned this project, I decided to make this a <span class="italicise">"base"</span> website so that I can add more stuff in the future to make it a formal portfolio. When it came to colours...the only one I liked was black and white. So I decided to make it all black and white. <span class="emphasise">Not because I'm lazy!</span></p>
		<p>To stick to tradition, I finished the bulk of it in an afternoon.</p>
